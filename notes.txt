- map object should accept a name or have some way of choosing Map
- remember to deallocate old maptiles array
- set up a post array creation where tile properties are updated
- make access to map tiles easy from the outside using grid coordinates
and solving for correct array inside the class.

    - (ISSUE)I have the map drawing and even loading from a map.txt file. I have textures managed
      so they are only loaded once, but currently I have only one texture variable that tries
      to access it, so when it requests again and the texture is already loaded, then the texture's
      address remains the same and the sf::Texture* variable still have valid data. But what if I
      create another sf::Texture* somewhere and request a texture that is already loaded, does the
      function still return the pointer to the texture's location? I think I might have forgotten that.

      - check if a second sf::Texture* requesting a texture that is already loaded will receive an address.

    - (CHARACTER)Let say that is taken care of or easy to fix. Then what? Next would be creating characters. How will I do this?
      What are character' properties? Some simple things.
        - health and stats in general, like names and such information.
        - position on Map
      Those things are a given, but what about characters as an object or struct?
        - They will need to have an associated texture for drawing the character.
        - A way to destroy the character?
        -
    - (TURN-BASED) How would I implement turn based combat? First I want to be able to draw stuff to places, and such.
    - (MENU) It doesn't really feel like a game without adding a menu or something.
